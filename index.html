                <p>I'm a programmer from Montana.</p>
                <p>This is a website to showcase some of the projects I work on.</p>
                <p>It also showcases some of my hobbies. I enjoy tracking my progress and achievements about as much as I enjoy my hobbies. So this is where I do that.</p>
