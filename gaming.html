                <h2>Single Player Games</h2>
                <p>I like these a lot. My favorites are Nintendo series like Zelda and Mario but I like lots of others too.</p>
                <p>I also really like to beat games. I have a large backlog but I like to beat all the games I play and I track my progress towards completing my backlog on <a href="https://backloggery.com/Pocodudeface">Backloggery</a>.</p>
                <p>I also like to make a little infographic of the games I play and beat every year. Check it out:</p> 
                <h2>Competitive Games</h2>
                <p>I'm not very good at competitive games. But I do complete in Super Smash Bros. Melee. I play Dr. Mario and started entering tournaments in college in 2016. You can see most of the tournaments I've entered on <a href="https://www.start.gg/user/cc39f15d/results">Smash.gg</a>. You can see some of my vods in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPTpsI0lBSI63oM0l2_Gqe7WE59CXHHdP">playlist</a>.</p>
                <p>I'm also pretty good at Mario Kart.</p>
